## Project Summary

We plan to develop a car rental service. Customers around the US will be able to look up available cars to rent based on their location, fuel type, vehicle type, fare per day, model and more. They can also search by preferred model choice and even search for cheaper options available in the area which closely matches this preferred model. Customers will also be able to look at past customers ratings and give their own ratings to the cars that they have rented.

As the car rental admin, we would be able to easily handle peopleâ€™s data including how many days they rent the car for and based on the fact that if the person who is trying to rent the car has a criminal history or is below 25, we may have to increase the insurance on the car. Along with this, if the car is being rented in a district with a high auto-theft rate then the admin could charge a higher fixed deposit on the rental. Admins will also have the ability to change all specifications and details regarding the car.
